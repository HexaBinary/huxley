BMUN’s team fee is ${{ registrationFee }}, paid once for an entire delegation regardless of its total delegate count.  This fee can be paid either via check made out to Berkeley Model United Nations sent to PO Box 4306, Berkeley, CA 94704-0306 or through an electronic invoice that will be sent through Quickbooks.  If you registered between 9/9 and 9/30, these fees are due 9/30; if you registered between 10/1 and 10/31, these fees are due 10/31; if you registered between 11/1 and 11/30, these fees are due 11/30. Note that this fee is non-refundable and failure to pay this fee by your required deadline will result in placement on our waitlist. 

This checklist item is updated manually by BMUN's Treasurer, {{ conferenceTreasurer }}, every non-holiday Wednesday and Sunday night on a rolling basis. If you submitted a payment and this item has not been checked, please contact info@bmun.org.
