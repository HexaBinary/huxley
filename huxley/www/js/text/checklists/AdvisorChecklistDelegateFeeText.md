BMUN’s delegate fee is ${{ delegateFee }} per delegate.  This fee can be paid either via check made out to Berkeley Model United Nations and sent to PO Box 4306, Berkeley, CA 94704-0306 or through an electronic invoice that will be sent through Quickbooks.  If you registered between 9/9 and 9/30, these fees are due 11/31; if you registered between 10/1 and 10/31, these fees are due 12/20; if you registered between 11/1 and 11/30, these fees are due 1/10.  Failure to meet these deadlines may result in country assignment forfeiture.

This checklist item is updated manually by BMUN's Treasurer, {{ conferenceTreasurer }}, every non-holiday Wednesday and Sunday night on a rolling basis. If you submitted a payment and this item has not been checked, please contact info@bmun.org.
